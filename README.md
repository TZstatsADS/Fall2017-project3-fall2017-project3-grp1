+ Project summary: In this project, we proposed an improvement on the current classification engine to classify dogs, muffins and fried chicken in terms of running cost (storage, memory and time) and prediction accuracy. The baseline model for comparison uses Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with decision stumps on 5000 SIFT features. Our proposed model consists of a Convolutional Neural Network with 2 convolutional layers. Before attaining the best model, we tried a different range of feature extraction methods, such as HOG and PCA, as well as different classification models, like LDA, Random Forest and SVM. We ca observe the prediction accuracy estimated by cross-validation of each feature extraction method and model in the following table:
